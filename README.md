# pythonflask-app

This web application is a "clone" of Twitter. It uses the Python Flask library along with a few others to make a simple app. 
The user can register and login to the app by using a username and a password. His data is stored in a database. 
The user can also interact with the app by spelling their name and receiving a greeting from the app.
